# FinalProject
University of Rochester CSC 161 Final Project

Stock market algorithms Python program that was created for my CSC 161 Final Project. Uses OOD to run.
Moving average was a required algorithm as it determined the average value of a stock from the past 20 days
Then decides to sell or buy 10 stocks if the moving average was greater than 5%.
Min was a requiered algorithm that I created that took a user inputted preference for the value that they would want
to buy or sell at. Then runs through, calculating the change of the stock by day and will sell a user inputted
amount of stocks. 

Not a lot of creative doing that I could have implemented as the TA's were pretty strict on following the guidelines
and not moving around how the program was created.
